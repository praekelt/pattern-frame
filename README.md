# Setsquare
A resizable iframe for patterns in pattern libraries.

## Setup
Currently assumes the presence of NVM. If not, `.nvmrc` has the version number the project depends on.

```
$ nvm use
$ npm install
$ npm run build
```

Currently there is no built-in server. Just drag `example/index.html` into a browser.
